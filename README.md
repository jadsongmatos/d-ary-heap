## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/jadson-goulart-de-matos-projects/v0-d-ary-heap-visualization](https://vercel.com/jadson-goulart-de-matos-projects/v0-d-ary-heap-visualization)**

## Features

- **Visualize D-ary Heaps:** See the tree structure of a D-ary heap (Min or Max) with adjustable branching factor (d).
- **Interactive Operations:** Perform common heap operations like Insertion and Extraction with animations.
- **Heapify:** Visualize the heapify process on a given set of elements.
- **Random Heap Generation:** Quickly generate a random heap for visualization.
- **Multiple Visualizations:** View the heap as a Graphviz tree, a level-by-level array representation, and a simple array list.
- **Operation Log:** Keep track of the operations performed on the heap.
- **Clear Heap:** Reset the visualizer.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Radix UI:** A collection of accessible, customizable UI components.
- **Graphviz (`@hpcc-js/wasm`):** Used for generating the tree structure visualization of the heap from DOT language.
